### Results 

1-	I found that guests prefer city hotel (61%) more than resort hotel (39%)  . the resort hotel can offer discount to increase the  number of booking .

2-	We can see that around ( 73 % ) of booking are not canceled but around ( 27%) are canceled 

3-	I notice also the number of booking during these years increasing over years (2016)

4-	The most guests come from PRT (27453)

5-	The prefer room type is A  (56552) guests. it means that the hotel should increase room A to maximize the revenue , and prefer Meal Type is BB (67978)

6-	The top agent in terms of booking is (9)

7-	We can see that number of repeated guest is very low in both hotels and that means we have negative growth of the hotel , and hotel can offer discount to their guests to increase repeated  and also  decrease the waiting time in city hotel


8-	The most guests prefer stay three days in city hotel & one day in resort hotel so the hotel should works on to increase total stay in resort hotel to increase revenue .

9-	The percentage of waiting time in city hotel (61%) is more than resort hotel (39%) as we saw above the people stay more in city hotel that means stakeholder should increase the room to decrease the waiting time.

10-	It is clear that both of them more revenue in August that means stakeholder could prepare more for this month because the revenue in this month is higher than any months.
